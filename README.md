# Quantifying-Polarization-on-Twitter

Several studies have been conducted to better understand, analyze, and quantify
social polarization, primarily in political domains through graph-based techniques. Only
a few recent research papers have proposed a single metric for polarization. The goal of
this research project is to understand the underlying mechanics of social polarization
and to be able to quantify a measure of polarization for a particular topic with non
graph-based methods. Here we report a procedure that analyzes the distribution of six
different properties that define a polarized topic. The polarized distribution is
constructed by first performing stance detection, utilizing Twitter data for the BeRT
model. Finally, we apply statistical calculations on the distribution and combine these
measures into a single metric for polarization.
